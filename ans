Here are Python programs for each of the tasks you've mentioned:

1. Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero:
```python
# Input a number
num = float(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check if it's positive, negative, or zero
if num > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif num < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")
```

2. Check if a number is odd or even:
```python
# Input a number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check if it's odd or even
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even.")
else:
    print("The number is odd.")
```

3. Check if a year is a leap year:
```python
# Input a year
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

# Check if it's a leap year
if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
```

4. Check if a number is prime:
```python
# Input a number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check if it's prime
if num > 1:
    for i in range(2, int(num/2) + 1):
        if (num % i) == 0:
            print(f"{num} is not a prime number.")
            break
    else:
        print(f"{num} is a prime number.")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not a prime number.")
```

5. Print all prime numbers in an interval of 1-10,000:
```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num > 1:
        for i in range(2, int(num/2) + 1):
            if (num % i) == 0:
                return False
        return True
    return False

# Find and print prime numbers in the interval
for num in range(1, 10001):
    if is_prime(num):
        print(num, end=" ")
```

These Python programs cover the tasks you specified. You can run them in a Python environment to check the results.
